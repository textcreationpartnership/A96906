            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HAving received your la≈øt, dated <hi>June</hi> 19. I find an earne≈øt expre≈ø≈øion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you de≈øire to be ≈øatisfied in that great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe now in di≈øpenbe betwixt the King, Parliament, and Army; and indeed, it is a

               <p>But ≈øome rumour it abroad, that although we have his per≈øon, we cannot attaine his heart; for it is ≈øaid, that his Maie≈øty hath lately ≈øent a Me≈ø≈øage (or Declaration) to the Militia and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> declaring his re≈øolution and intention concerning the pre≈øent de≈øign of the Army; the heads wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ≈øhall briefly communicate unto you, as followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <label>The fir≈øt Propo≈øition.</label> 1. His Maje≈øty doth propound, that He hath no de≈øire to comply with the proceedings of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ≈øaying, that he admired at their actions, and wondred by what Authority they dur≈øt pre≈øume to do that which they have already done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That He de≈øired to re≈øide no longer at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market, for he found him≈øelf an ab≈øolute pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but with all willingne≈ø≈øe, (according to the Votes of both Hou≈øes of Parliament) would take his Journey towards <hi>Richmond,</hi> that ≈øo a firme Peace might ≈øpeedily be ≈øetled within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:160321:3"/> 3. That his Maie≈øty de≈øires nothing more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly, then to joyn with his two Hou≈øes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a≈ø≈øembled at We≈øtmin≈øter, that ≈øo by the happy uniting of the Head and Body, there may be a ≈øpeedy compo≈øure of all differences now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øing within this langui≈øhing Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That for His Maie≈øties having any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondencie with the pre≈øent de≈øignes or actions of the Armie, He doth declare to all his loving Subjects the contrary, prote≈øting again≈øt all their proceedings, and that what≈øoever they heard to the contrary, de≈øired them not to believe, no, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, unle≈ø≈øe they ≈øpake with one who had it from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you the chiefe heads of his Maie≈øties late Propo≈øitions to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of London for a ≈øafe and well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded peace, I ≈øhall now endeavour to ≈øatisfie your expectation, concerning the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions ≈øent from the Commi≈ø≈øioners at Newmarket, to his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> at St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> which followeth in the≈øe words:</p>
               <p>1 According to the Votes of both Hou≈øes of Parliament, you are required to deliver the
<pb facs="tcp:160321:4"/> per≈øon of the King to ≈øuch per≈øons as both Hou≈øes ≈øhall appoint, to be placed at Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, under ≈øuch guards, and in ≈øuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they ≈øhall think fit.

               </p>
               <p>After reading of the ≈øaid Propo≈øitions, the Generall ≈øummoned divers Collonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, and Captains to his quarters, to debate and con≈øult there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; but at the clo≈øe of this Letter, they had not concluded of any thing, divers que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being propounded which highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the King: therefore, for further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I refer you to the inclo≈øed papers, and remaine</p>
